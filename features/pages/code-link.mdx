Code Link provides a convenient way to onboard new users and can be used across all code types supported by the platform.

Affiliates can share a link to their campaign code with their audience making the onboarding process streamlined.

A link to the referral code page can be shared between users for faster onboarding.

A link to the promo code page can be shared to attract new users to your app.

In combination with deep links, Code Link can be used to onboard new users with a two-step process.

## Format

A code link has the following format: `https://<subdomain>.wwk.link/<code>`.

## Example

An example of the Code Link page for the [Usage](https://usage.pro) app, available at [https://usage.wwk.link/NMB231](https://usage.wwk.link/NMB231).

### Deep Links

Deep links can be used to open the app directly from the Code Link page and enable two-step instructions shown on the page.

#### Configuring

Navigate to Pages -> Code Link -> Deep Links to configure the deep links.

Configure a deep link for each platform where your app is available, or set a single deep link that works across all platforms.

<Warning>
  You are responsible for setting up the deep links handling in your app. When
  receiving a deep link, you can present a view, claim the received code, or
  implement any other functionality that suits your needs.
</Warning>

## Access

### Affiliate Code

The affiliate code link is available on the dashboard for active and archived campaigns.

### Referral Code

The referral code link value is available on the user object via SDKs and REST API.

#### Swift SDK

The Code Link value is available on the User object as the `referralCodeLink` property.

Get it from the singleton instance:

```swift
let referralCodeLink = Referrals.shared.user?.referralCodeLink
```

Or in a SwiftUI view from the observable object:

```swift
@State var referralsObservableObject = Referrals.shared.observableObject

...

Text(self.referralsObservableObject.user?.referralCodeLink ?? "-")
```

Learn more about [Swift SDK](/integrations/swift-sdk).

#### TypeScript SDK

The Code Link value is available on the user object as the `referral_code_link` property.

```typescript
const user = await winwinkit.fetchUser({ appUserId: "<app-user-id>" });
const referralCodeLink = user?.referral_code_link;
```

#### REST API

The Code Link value is part of the User object:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "app_user_id": "821fae4b5-1a2d-4c1e-9152-5297086a161c",
      "referral_code": "XYZ123",
      "referral_code_link": "https://example.wwk.link/XYZ123",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

### Promo Code
