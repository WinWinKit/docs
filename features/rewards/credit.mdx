## Examples

There are many ways how the credit reward type can be utilized.
Below are a few of them:

- **Trial Days**: Grant a user with a number of trial days. One day equals one credit.
- **AI Requests**: Grant additional requests as a reward. One request equals one credit.
- **Game Levels**: Unlock a number of levels in a game. One level equals one credit.

## Withdrawing

As a user utilizes the credits, you need to withdraw them.

In your integration use a method from our SDK or call the REST API endpoint to withdraw credits.
