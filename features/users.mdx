![Users](/images/users-list.png)

To integrate referral program, you must register users of your app in WinWinKit. Learn more about supported [integrations](/general/introduction/#integrations).

## User Properties

### Configurable

These are the properties that you can use to update your user entities in WinWinKit.

#### App User Id (Required)

The only mandatory property that uniquely identifies a user within your app and in WinWinKit.

Normally it is a universally unique identifier (UUID).

#### Is Premium

Flag determining premium status of a user.

Used with the [Activation on Conversion](/features/referrals#activation) configuration and for tracking referring user's [Stats](/features/users#stats).

We recommend updating it whenever user's premium status changes.

<UserIsPremiumRevenueCat />

#### First Seen At

Date when the user was first seen in your app.

Used to determine user's eligibility to claim a referral code. Learn more about [Claim Code Elibigility](/features/users#claim-code-eligibility)

#### Last Seen At

Date when the user was last seen in your app.

Tracked automatically if integrated via [Swift SDK](/integrations/swift-sdk).

#### Metadata

A metadata object.

This allows you to provide extra configuration and metadata making it flexible to meet your specific needs.
Must be a valid JSON object.

### Provided by WinWinKit

These are the properties provided by WinWinKit that reflect user's referral data, active and expired rewards, and stats.

#### Referral Code

Unique referral code for the user.

A referral code is always 6 characters long and consists of a combination of letters and numbers.

<Info>The code is unique within your app.</Info>

<Info>Is assigned once and never changes.</Info>

Example: **XYZ123**

#### Referral Code Link

A web url to the referral code and its rewards which your app users can share with friends.

Learn more about how to set up [Code Link](/features/pages/code-link).

**Example**: `https://appname.wwk.link/XYZ123`

#### Referral Program

An object containing complete information about the referral program assigned to the user.
Can be used to create dynamic user interface based on the program configurations.

#### Claim Code Eligibility

An object providing information about user's eligibility to claim a referral code.

<Info>**An eligible user is allowed to claim a referral code.**</Info>

**Eligibility Rules**

Currently, WinWinKit implements a few simple rules for limiting the types of users eligible to claim a referral code.

- A user must not be older than 7 days.

  Because referral is for inviting new users, this restricts users from getting rewards without referring new users.

  The reference date used is the [First Seen At](/features/users#first-seen-at), if provided; otherwise, the date when the user was created in WinWinKit is used.

  {" "}

  <Info>
    Does this rule seem reasonable? If not, we would love to hear your feedback.
  </Info>

- The program limit has not been reached.

  The reference program here is referring user's program.
  Read more about Programs [Limit](/features/referrals/) configuration.

  {" "}

  <Info>
    By default there is no limit, and it must be specified for this rule to
    apply.
  </Info>

- A user can claim a code only once.

- A user cannot claim own code.

<Info>
  You can impose further limitations on a user's ability to claim a referral
  code, but cannot prolong elibility conditions imposed by WinWinKit. Once a
  user is not eligible according to WinWinKit, there is no override.
</Info>

<Info>
  If a user attempts to claim a referral code when not eligible, WinWinKit
  provides a descriptive message explaining the reason for the decline.
</Info>

**Example**

The `eligible` field indicates whether the user can claim the referral code, while `eligible_until` specifies the expiration date.

```json
"claim_code_eligibility": {
  "eligible": true,
  "eligible_until": "2025-02-10T10:28:18.104Z"
}
```

#### Stats

An object with information about referral statistics for the user.

Provides three values:

- Claims - how many invited users claimed the user's referral code.
- Conversions - how many of those who claimed the user's referral code became premium users.
- Churns - how many of those who claimed the user's referral code became premium users and then churned.

<Info>
  Correct tracking of Conversions and Churns requires updating [Is
  Premium](/features/users#is-premium) flag.
</Info>

**Example**

```json
"stats": {
  "claims": 10,
  "conversions": 8,
  "churns": 1
}
```

#### Rewards

A list of active and expired rewards for the user.

<Warning>Remember to unlock access to the active rewards in your app.</Warning>
