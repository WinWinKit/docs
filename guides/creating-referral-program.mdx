## 1. Create a Reward

First, you need to create rewards, which is an essential part of any referral program.
A reward represent a level of access, feature, or content that a user is "rewarded" with.

To create a reward click "Rewards" tab on the sidebar, then click "+ New Reward" button.

Fill in the information about the new reward, such as name and optionally description.

The key field is auto-complete based on the entered name, and can be modified if needed.

The key is a stable and machine-readable string value meant to be used for granting users access to their rewards. Once the reward is saved, its key cannot be changed.

Create other rewards relevant for your product, or continue to the next step.

Learn more about [Rewards](/features/rewards/introduction).

## 2. Create a Referral Program

Finally we have everything needed to create the first referral program! ðŸŽ‰

Click "Programs" tab on the sidebar, then click "+ New Program" button.

Enter a name and optionally description.

Then select rewards for the referring and invited users. Each side can be configured with different rewards.

## 3. Activate the Referral Program

Once the referral program is saved, it is ready to be activated.

An active program means that any app users created through an integration will be assigned to that program.
Once a user is assigned to the program, they receive a unique referral code that can be shared with and claimed by other users of your app.

<Info>
  Currently WinWinKit supports only one active program at a time. We're working
  towards allowing multiple active programs with split distribution and
  targeting.

## 4. Integrate

Now that your program is set up, it's time to integrate WinWinKit into your application.
We provide multiple integration options to suit your needs, including native SDKs and a REST API.
Choose the integration method that best fits your tech stack and development workflow.
