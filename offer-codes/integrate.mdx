Once everything is set up in App Store Connect and WinWinKit, you need to add support for Offer Codes in your app.

## Support Offer Codes

When a user is rewarded with an Offer Code, there is two ways they can redeem it:
- through a redemption URL, which opens the App Store
- directly in your app.

WinWinKit supports both ways, so you can choose which one to use.
However, we recommend you implement support for both ways.

### Redemption URL

Follow the Apple's documentation to implement support for Offer Codes redeemed outside of your app:

[Support offer codes redeemed outside of your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/supporting-subscription-offer-codes-in-your-app#Support-offer-codes-redeemed-outside-of-your-app)

<Info>
If you use [RevenueCat](https://revenuecat.com/), you don't need to implement this, as their SDK listens for `updates` on `Transaction` already. 
</Info>

### Inside app

Follow the Apple's documentation to implement support for Offer Codes redeemed in your app:

[Redeem offer codes in your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/supporting-subscription-offer-codes-in-your-app#Redeem-offer-codes-in-your-app)

<Info>
Essentially you only need to present a native sheet where user can enter the Offer Code value.
</Info>

## Retrieve and Redeem Offer Code

WinWinKit provides Offer Code value for active rewards for the user.

Available Offer Code reward and value can be retrived on the `User` object.

**Retrieving Offer Code value with Swift SDK:**

```swift
let offerCodeRewards = Referrals.shared.user?.rewards.active.offerCode
let offerCodeReward = offerCodeRewards?.first

// The value that can be presented to the user, and they can redeem in the app. 
let offerCodeValue = offerCodeReward?.value.value

// The redemption URL that can be used to redeem the Offer Code in the App Store.
// You can open this URL to prompt the user to redeem it.
let offerCodeRedemptionURL = offerCodeReward?.value.link

// The expiration date of the Offer Code value. 
// After the expiration date, a new value will be assigned, unless the reward is expired before.
let offerCodeExpirationDate = offerCodeReward?.value.expiresAt
```

<Info>
For new users, redeeming an Offer Code is starting a subscription in your app.
</Info>

<Info>
For existing users, redeeming an Offer Code is starting, adding, changing, renewing or getting temporary discount on a subscription in their account.
What happens depends on the subscription type and the Offer Code they redeem.
