Offer codes is a type of subscription offers on the App Store.
Use them to acquire, retain, and re-acquire subscribers by providing a subscription at a discount or for free for a limited time. 

With WinWinKit you can create a peer-to-peer referral program that enables current users to share an offer code and receive a benefit for promoting your app.
