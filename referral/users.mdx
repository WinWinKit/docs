To integrate referral program, you must register users of your app in WinWinKit. Learn more about supported [integrations](/quickstart/#6-integrate).

## User Properties

### Configurable

These are the properties that you can use to update your user entities in WinWinKit.

#### App User Id (Required)

The only mandatory property that uniquely identifies a user within your app and in WinWinKit. 

Normally it is a universally unique identifier (UUID).

#### Is Premium

Flag determining premium status of a user. 

Used with the [Activation on Conversion](/referral/programs#activation) configuration and for tracking referring user's [Stats](/referral/users#stats). 

We recommend updating it whenever user's premium status changes. 

#### First Seen At

Date when the user was first seen in your app. 

Used to determine user's eligibility to claim a referral code. Learn more about [Claim Code Elibigility](/referral/users#claim-code-eligibility) 

#### Last Seen At

Date when the user was last seen in your app.

Tracked automatically if integrated via [Swift SDK](/integrations/swift-sdk).

#### Metadata

A metadata object.

This allows you to provide extra configuration and metadata making it flexible to meet your specific needs. 
Must be a valid JSON object.

### Provided by WinWinKit

These are the properties provided by WinWinKit that reflect user's referral data, active and expired rewards, and stats.

#### Code

Unique referral code for the user.

A referral code is always 6 characters long and consists of a combination of letters and numbers.

<Info>
The code is unique within your app. 
</Info>

<Info>
Is assigned once and never changes.
</Info>

Example: **XYZ123**

#### Preview Link

A web url to the referral code and its rewards which your app users can share with friends.

Learn more about how to set up [Preview Link](/referral/preview-link).

**Example**: `https://appname.wwk.link/XYZ123`

#### Program

An object containing complete information about the program assigned to the user.

#### Claim Code Eligibility

An object providing information about user's eligibility to claim a referral code.

<Info>
**An eligible user is allowed to claim a referral code.**
</Info>

**Eligibility Rules**

Currently, WinWinKit implements a few simple rules for limiting the types of users eligible to claim a referral code.

- A user must not be older than 7 days.

    Because referral is for inviting new users, this restricts users from getting rewards without referring new users.
    
    The reference date used is the [First Seen At](/referral/users#first-seen-at), if provided; otherwise, the date when the user was created in WinWinKit is used.

    <Info>
    Does this rule seem reasonable? If not, we would love to hear your feedback.
    </Info>

- The program limit has not been reached.

    The reference program here is referring user's program.
    Read more about Programs [Limit](/referral/programs/) configuration. 

    <Info>
    By default there is no limit, and it must be specified for this rule to apply.
    </Info>

- A user can claim a code only once.

- A user cannot claim own code.

<Info>
You can impose further limitations on a user's ability to claim a referral code, but cannot prolong elibility conditions imposed by WinWinKit. 
Once a user is not eligible according to WinWinKit, there is no override. 
</Info>

<Info>
If a user attempts to claim a referral code when not eligible, WinWinKit provides a descriptive message explaining the reason for the decline. 
</Info>

**Example**

The `eligible` field indicates whether the user can claim the referral code, while `eligible_until` specifies the expiration date.

```json
"claim_code_eligibility": {
  "eligible": true,
  "eligible_until": "2025-02-10T10:28:18.104Z"
}
```

#### Rewards

A list of active and expired rewards for the user.

<Warning>
Remember to unlock access to the active rewards in your app.
</Warning>

#### Stats

An object with information about referral statistics for the user.

Provides three values:

- Claims - how many invited users claimed the user's referral code.
- Conversions - how many of those who claimed the user's referral code became premium users. 
- Churns - how many of those who claimed the user's referral code became premium users and then churned.

<Info>
Correct tracking of Conversions and Churns requires updating [Premium](/referral/users#is-premium) flag for the users.
</Info>

**Example**

```json
"stats": {
  "claims": 10,
  "conversions": 8,
  "churns": 1
}
```
