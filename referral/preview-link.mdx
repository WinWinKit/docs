</Warning>

### Logo

Upload app icon.

### Name

Name of the app.

### Description

Short description of the app. 

### Link

Set the link to where your app is available. This can be a link to the App Store or website. See [Deep Links](#deep-links) for more configuration options.

### Deep Links

Deep links are used to open the app directly from the Preview Link page.

Configure a deep link for each platform where your app is available, or set a single deep link that works across all platforms.

<Tip>
  Enter `$code` as part of your deep link url to receive a referral code value. 
  
  For example, `myapp://open/referral?code=$code` will result in `myapp://open/referral?code=XYZ123`, when the referral code is `XYZ123`.
</Tip>

<Info>
  You are responsible for setting up the deep links handling in your app.
  When receiving a deep link, you can present a view, claim the received referral code, or implement any other functionality that suits your app's needs.
