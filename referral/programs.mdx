## Setting Up

### General

#### Name and Description

Name and optional description that are meant for internal use.

### Rewards

Rewards are essential part of any referral program and represent a level of access, feature, or content that a user is "rewarded" with.
Learn more about [Rewards](/referral/rewards).

#### Referring vs Invited users

Referring users are those who invite others to your app. They initiate the referral by sharing their unique referral code.

Invited users are new users to your app who are referred by the referring users. 

This dual-reward system creates a mutually beneficial environment, encouraging both parties to participate actively in the referral.

#### Activation

Each reward for either referring or invited users has its own configuration for when it should be activated, which determines when the party should be rewarded.

**Claim**

For **the referring user**, activate the reward when invited user(s) claim the referral code.
The number defines how many invited users should claim the referral code for the reward to be activated.
For example, the default value "1" means that the reward to be activated when the first invited user claims the referral code.

For **the invited users**, activate the reward once the referral code is claimed.
Note there is no number selection for Activation - invited users have no further relations.

**Conversion**

For **the referring user**, activate the reward when invited user(s) claim the referral code and then become premium.
The number defines how many invited users should claim and convert for the reward to be activated.
For example, the default value "1" means that the reward to be activated when the first invited user converts to premium.

For **the invited users**, activate the reward when converted to premium.
Note there is no number selection for Activation - invited users have no further relations.

<Warning>
Using **Conversion** type for activating rewards requires continious updates to the `is_premium` property for users. Read more about [Users](/referral/users).
</Warning>

#### Deactivation

Each reward has deactivation configurations.

**Never**

Once the reward is activated, the user will retain it indefinitely.

**Interval**

Once the reward is activated, the user retains it for a specified duration.

<Info>
Check out how "Free Month" reward is configured in the [Example Program](/referral/programs#3-rewards-for-the-invited-user) below.
</Info>

### Configs

#### Limit

In some cases, it may be beneficial to restrict the number of invited users who can utilize the same referral code.

The default setting is Unlimited, but this can be adjusted to any number up to 100.

If you require a different limit than what is currently offered, [please contact us](/support/contact-us).

#### Metadata

This allows you to provide extra configuration and metadata making it flexible to meet your specific needs. 
Must be a valid JSON object.

## Activation

An active program means that any app users created through an integration will be assigned to that program. 
Once a user is assigned to the program, they receive a unique referral code that can be shared with and claimed by other users of your app.

By default every new program is Inactive.

#### How to Activate

Click the three-dots icon on the right side of a row and click "Activate":

![Activate Program](/images/activate-program.png)

<Warning>
Currently WinWinKit supports **only one active program at a time**. 
We're working towards allowing multiple active programs with split distribution and targeting.
</Warning>

## Re-assignment

Currently it is not possible to explicitly re-assign a user to a different program.

If a program is deleted, then users who have been assigned to that program will be assigned to the active program. 
If there is no active program, users won't have any program. 
It is also technically possible to have users with referral code but not a program.

<Info>
Referral code can be assigned to a user only once.
While it is technically possible for the user to be assigned to different programs, their referral code won't change.
</Info>

<Warning>
Activate and delete programs with caution to prevent unexpected issues. In production, it is good practice to always have an active program.
</Warning>

## Example Program

Let's create a program that rewards users for inviting others. 
As an example, we'll set up a program where:

- Referring user gets a new app icon for each person they invite, with three icons to be rewarded in total.
- Every invited user receives a free month.

<Info>
Following example assumes there are appropriate rewards configured. Learn more about [Rewards](/referral/rewards).
</Info>

This creates a win-win situation where both parties benefit from the referral.

**Step-by-step guide**

#### 1. Name and description

Enter a name and optional description.

![Create program](/images/create-program-1.png)

#### 2. Rewards for the referring user 

Since we have three app icons to reward the referring user, we need to add three separate rewards.

**2.1.** Click "+ Add Reward" in the "Referring user" section. 
   
The dropdown will show all available rewards.
   
![Create program](/images/create-program-2.png)

**2.2** Select the first reward for the referring user. Let it be "App Icon Candy".

![Create program](/images/create-program-3.png)

The reward is now selected and has the default configurations:

Activation "Claim", the reward is activated when one invited user claims the referring user's referral code.

Deactivation "Never", the referring user keeps the reward forever.

**2.3** Select the second reward "App Icon Hologram".

Since we want the second icon to be rewarded for the second invited user, we need to change Activation on Claim number to 2.

![Create program](/images/create-program-4.png)

**2.4** Select the last reward "App Icon Neon".

Similar to the previous step, we want the third icon to be rewarded for the third invited user, so we need to change Activation on Claim number to 3.

![Create program](/images/create-program-5.png)

Now the rewards for the referring user are ready.

#### 3. Rewards for the invited user

**3.1.** Again, click "+ Add Reward", but now for the "Invited user" section.

![Create program](/images/create-program-6.png)

**3.2.** Select the reward "Free Month".

The reward is now selected and has the default configurations:

![Create program](/images/create-program-7.png)

Now we should change the Deactivation to "Interval" with "1 Months" duration. 
This will ensure that the invited user won't keep the reward after 1 month from when the reward was activation.
