A referral program defines the rewards that users receive for inviting others and being invited.

## Example Program

Let's create a program that rewards users for inviting others. 
As an example, we'll set up a program where:

- Referring user gets a new app icon for each person they invite, with three icons to be rewarded in total.
- Every invited user receives a free month.

<Info>
Following example assumes there are appropriate rewards configured. Learn more about [Rewards](/referral/rewards).
</Info>

This creates a win-win situation where both parties benefit from the referral.

**Step-by-step guide**

#### 1. Name and description

Enter a name and optional description.

<Info>
Name and description are meant for internal purpose and are not used in the [Preview Link](/referral/preview-link).

#### 2. Rewards for the referring user 

Since we have three app icons to reward the referring user, we need to add three separate rewards.

**2.1.** Click "+ Add Reward" in the "Referring user" section. 
   
The dropdown will show all available rewards.

**2.2** Select the first reward for the referring user. Let it be "App Icon Candy".

The reward is now selected and has the default configurations:

Activation "Claim", the reward is activated when one invited user claims the referring user's referral code.

Deactivation "Never", the referring user keeps the reward forever.

**2.3** Select the second reward "App Icon Hologram".

Since we want the second icon to be rewarded for the second invited user, we need to change Activation on Claim number to 2.

**2.4** Select the last reward "App Icon Neon".

Similar to the previous step, we want the third icon to be rewarded for the third invited user, so we need to change Activation on Claim number to 3.

Now the rewards for the referring user are ready.

#### 3. Rewards for the invited user

**3.1.** Again, click "+ Add Reward", but now for the "Invited user" section.

**3.2.** Select the reward "Free Month".

The reward is now selected and has the default configurations:

Note there is no number selection for Activation - invited users have no further relations.

Now we should change the Deactivation to "Interval" with "1 Months" duration. 
This will ensure that the invited user won't keep the reward after 1 month from when the reward was activation.
