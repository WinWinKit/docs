<Warning>**Subdomain can be set only once.**</Warning>

### Logo

Upload app icon.

### Name

Name of the app.

### Description

Short description of the app.

### Link

Set the link to where your app is available. This can be a link to the App Store or website. See [Deep Links](#deep-links) for more configuration options.

### Deep Links

Deep links are used to open the app directly from the Code Link page.

Configure a deep link for each platform where your app is available, or set a single deep link that works across all platforms.

<Tip>
  Enter `$code` as part of your deep link url to receive a code value. For
  example, `myapp://claim-code?code=$code` will result in
  `myapp://claim-code?code=XYZ123`, when the code is `XYZ123`.
</Tip>

<Info>
  You are responsible for setting up the deep links handling in your app. When
  receiving a deep link, you can present a view, claim the received referral
  code, or implement any other functionality that suits your app's needs.

## Access

### Swift SDK

The Code Link value is available on the User object as the `referralCodeLink` property.

Get it from the singleton instance:

```swift
let referralCodeLink = Referrals.shared.user?.referralCodeLink
```

Or in a SwiftUI view from the observable object:

```swift
@State var referralsObservableObject = Referrals.shared.observableObject

...

Text(self.referralsObservableObject.user?.referralCodeLink ?? "-")
```

Learn more about [Swift SDK](/integrations/swift-sdk).

### TypeScript SDK

The Code Link value is available on the user object as the `referral_code_link` property.

```typescript
const user = await winwinkit.fetchUser({ appUserId: "<app-user-id>" });
const referralCodeLink = user?.referral_code_link;
```

### REST API

The Code Link value is part of the User object:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "app_user_id": "821fae4b5-1a2d-4c1e-9152-5297086a161c",
