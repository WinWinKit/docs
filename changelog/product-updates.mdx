  ## RevenueCat Rewards

![RevenueCat Rewards](/images/changelog-revenuecat-rewards.png)

We've added support for two new reward types that tie into RevenueCat:

- **Entitlement**: Reward users with RevenueCat entitlements.
- **Offering**: Reward users with a specific RevenueCat offering.

Both reward types are fully configurable with referral logic in WinWinKit and can be rewarded for a specific period of time too.

Head to Settings -> Integrations -> RevenueCat to enable the new reward types.

  ## Deep Links Support

![Deep Links](/images/changelog-deep-links-usage.png)

We've added support for configuring deep links that open the app directly from the Preview Link page.
It enables creating a streamlined user experience and allows configuring deep links per supported platform.

Additionally, we've added the ability to preview deep links and programs directly in the dashboard - simply select the configurations you want to preview.

### Preview Link Dashboard Page

We've made it easier to discover the Preview Link in the dashboard - now it has its own place on the sidebar.

  ## Offer Codes Support

![Offer Codes](/images/changelog-offer-codes.png)

Growing your app's subscription base just became much easier! ðŸŽ‰

We've added support for Offer Codes, enabling a whole new way for attracting new and engaging existing users in promoting your app.

Offer Codes are Apple's native way to reward users with a free or discounted subscription offer. They're powerful, but usually difficult to set up and manage across real campaigns.

With WinWinKit, that's now handled automatically!

You can create referral programs where:

- Offer Codes are generated and assigned when needed
- Logic and delivery are fully managed inside the platform
- Users get the right reward at the right time â€” without any extra tooling or backend work.

  ## Meet WinWinKit!

![Meet WinWinKit](/images/changelog-meet.png)

We're excited to share that [WinWinKit](https://winwinkit.com) is now available for everyone!

[WinWinKit](https://winwinkit.com) is built on the simple concept of a referral code. Each user of the app users gets a unique referral code that can be used to invite new users for a reward. What rewards are, when they apply, which party receives what, is entirely under your control and can be set up with a few clicks.

Why add referrals?

- Referrals are a great way to engage users in the promotion of your app.
- Referrals unlock a new organic marketing channel.
- Users interacting with the referral become more attached to the product.

[WinWinKit](https://winwinkit.com) provides a hassle-free way to add a referral to your app.
Setting up a referral program takes just a few clicks and minimal integration!
