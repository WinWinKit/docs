## Base URL

The WinWinKit API is built on REST principles.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://api.winwinkit.com
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an `x-api-key` header with the contents of the header being your API Key. All API endpoints are authenticated using Api Keys and picked up from the specification file.

```json
{
    "headers": {
      "x-api-key": "wwk_abcd1234efgh5678"
    }
}
```


## Response codes

WinWinKit uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests. In general, 2xx HTTP codes correspond to success, 4xx codes are for user-related failures, and 5xx codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Description                          |
