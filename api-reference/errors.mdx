## Overview

When you send a request to the WinWinKit API, you receive a response that includes an HTTP status code and, in most cases, a response body. 
To determine your request’s status and handle errors, use the HTTP status code along with the code from the Error Response. 
Interpret the error starting with the most general information first.

## Response Codes

WinWinKit uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests. 
In general, 2xx HTTP codes correspond to success, 4xx codes are for user-related failures, and 5xx codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Name | Description |
|:-----------|:-----|:------------|
| 200 | OK | Success. |
| 201 | Created | Object created. |
| 400 | Bad Request | Check that the request format was correct. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | The API key used was missing or invalid. |
| 404 | Not Found | The resource was not found. |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | Check that the request data was correct. |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | The rate limit was exceeded. |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Indicates an error with WinWinKit servers. |

## Error Response

The error details that an API returns in the response body whenever the API request isn’t successful. Contains an array of one or more errors.

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "<string>",
      "status": <number>,
      "title": "<string>",
      "source": "<string | null>"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Parse the Error Code

The code property is a stable, machine-readable value indicating the exact type of error. 
The code is hierarchical, with dots separating the information about the error from general to specific. 
The more information the system has about the error, the more levels the error code includes. 

| Status | Code | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| 400 | BAD_REQUEST | The request is not valid. |
| 400 | BODY_INVALID | The request body is the wrong type and is not valid JSON. |
| 401 | UNAUTHORIZED | The rate limit was exceeded. |
| 403 | FORBIDDEN | The method and path combination is valid, but not allowed due to access restrictions. |
| 404 | NOT_FOUND | The resource does not exist. |
| 404 | PATH_ERROR | The path is not valid. For example, GET `https://api.winwinkit.com/lol` is not a valid path in this API. |
| 405 | METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED | The method and path combination is not valid in the API. |
| 422 | PARAMETER_ERROR.INVALID | The parameter is allowed but has an invalid value or type. |
| 422 | PARAMETER_ERROR.REQUIRED | A required parameter is missing. |
| 500 | INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR | Indicates an error with WinWinKit servers. |
