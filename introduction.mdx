WinWinKit is a platform for referral and affiliate marketing in mobile apps.

Three key features of WinWinKit:

**Referrals**: Invite existing users to invite their friends, family, colleagues, followers to your app for a reward for them and the invited people.

**Affiliates**: Invite bloggers, influencers, or other content creators to promote
your app for a commission. Configure the rewards for the invited users for better
incentivization.

**Promos**: Attract new users by distributing promo codes.

## Quickstart

The first step to start using WinWinKit is to create an account, configure a referral program and begin integration via SDK or REST API.
